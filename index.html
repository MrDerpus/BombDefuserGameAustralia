		<h2>Trying for about 2 days, trying to get the game to work on Windows XP has been a nightmare.</h2>
		<h2>The bugs include:</h2>
		<h3>- Not being able to get cURL to work on Windows XP on its own, but cURL works when using the GIT console.</h3><br>
		<h3>- This version, being the last supported version of the git console that works on XP does not run <br>
		the program well at all, when you play the game, it doesn't like the async functions for the game.<br>
	     The game is meant to display on the screen and then wait for input.<br>
	    The git console just holts and then fails player fails that attempt.</h3><br>
		<h3>- Minimal graphic errors when using GIT, running the game itself fails with escape chars.</h3-->
